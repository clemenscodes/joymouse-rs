# JoyMouse üéÆüê≠

_Turn your mouse into a virtual gamepad!_

**JoyMouse** is a lightweight, cross-platform input daemon
that emulates a virtual game controller, mapping mouse movement to analog stick input.
Ideal for emulators like [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/),
particularly in first-person shooters
or camera-driven games where mouse precision is key.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üñ±Ô∏è **Mouse ‚Üí Right Analog Stick** mapping
-   üéÆ **Virtual Controller Emulation**
    -   **Linux:** Uses `evdev` for input parsing and `uinput` to create a virtual controller
    -   **Windows:** Uses `device query` for input and [`ViGEmClient`](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmClient) + [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) for virtual gamepad creation
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Settings**
-   üß≠ Auto recenter analog stick after idle
-   üêß **Linux support** (fully functional)
-   üíª **Windows support** (in progress)
-   üîí Built with **modern Rust** (‚â•1.87.0)

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

-   **Linux:**

    -   Reads input events using [`evdev`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libevdev/)
    -   Creates a virtual device via [`uinput`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/input/uinput.html)
    -   Emits events as if from a real controller

-   **Windows:**
    -   Parses events using device APIs
    -   Emulates a virtual controller using [`ViGEmClient`](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmClient)
        and [`ViGEmBus`](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîΩ Downloads

The latest releases can be downloaded from the [Downloads section](https://github.com/clemenscodes/joymouse-rs/releases/tag/latest).

For Windows, you can directly download the binary here:  
[joymouse.exe](https://github.com/clemenscodes/joymouse-rs/releases/download/latest/joymouse.exe)
To create the virtual controller, installing the ViGEmBus Driver is required. You can download the driver [here](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/download/v1.22.0/ViGEmBus_1.22.0_x64_x86_arm64.exe).
Just double click the executable file. It should open a window that says that JoyMouse started.

For Linux, you can directly download the binary here:  
[joymouse](https://github.com/clemenscodes/joymouse-rs/releases/download/latest/joymouse-musl-static)
For a seemless experience, it is recommended to add your user to the `input` group. This allows reading `/dev/input` without needing `sudo` and thus running the binary without `sudo`.
To add your user to the `input` group, run the following command `sudo usermod -a -G input $USER`.
Then simply run the downloaded binary in the terminal.

### üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clemenscodes/joymouse.git
cd joymouse
cargo build --release
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

JoyMouse uses two TOML configuration files located in your OS-specific configuration directory:

-   **Linux:** `~/.config/joymouse/`
-   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\joymouse\`

### **1. joymouse.toml** ‚Äì Mouse & Stick Settings

This file defines settings for right analog stick emulation and tuning.

```toml
tickrate = 16
mouse_idle_timeout = 64
max_tilt_range = 32767.0
min_tilt_range = 13107.0
sensitivity = 7.0
blend = 0.2
diagonal_boost = 1.41
angle_delta_limit = 0.5
speed_stabilize_threshold = 200.0
min_speed_clamp = 1.0
max_speed_clamp = 500.0
motion_threshold_micro_macro = 0.025
motion_threshold_macro_flick = 0.5
motion_threshold_macro_micro = 0.03
motion_threshold_micro_macro_recover = 0.01
```
